## INLG 2025: First Call for Workshop & Tutorial Proposals

18th International Conference on Natural Language Generation
Hanoi, Vietnam, October 29 - November 2, 2025. 

---

The 18th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG 2025) will be held in Hanoi, Vietnam, from October 29 to November 2, 2025. Building on the success of previous conferences, we aim to include a diverse range of independently organized research workshops and tutorials. These events will take place either immediately before or after the main conference. The INLG organizers, in collaboration with SIGGEN, warmly invite proposals for one-day or half-day workshops at INLG 2025.
 
Hosting a workshop at INLG 2025 offers a unique opportunity to connect with leading researchers and practitioners in the field of Natural Language Generation. Workshops provide a platform for networking, fostering collaborations, and exchanging innovative ideas. They also allow organizers and participants to gain valuable exposure to cutting-edge research, attract attention to emerging topics, and shape future directions in the NLG community.
 
We welcome proposals on any topic relevant to the Natural Language Generation (NLG) community. Submissions focusing on emerging areas of interest or topics that foster collaboration between the NLG community and other established research fields are highly encouraged. Additionally, proposals that continue an existing workshop series are welcome.
 
Workshops and tutorials should provide an engaging and informal setting where participants can discuss technical topics and exchange ideas. Proposals should outline the format of the workshop or tutorial, and we encourage interactive formats, such as talks, posters, panels, and invited speaker sessions. Workshops and tutorials at INLG 2025 are expected to be either half-day or full-day events.
 
Proposals can be directly sent to the INLG 2025 Workshop Chair, Xiao-Yong Wei (email: cs007.wei@polyu.edu.hk). Should you have any questions, feel free to contact the Workshop Chair.
