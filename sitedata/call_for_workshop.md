### INLG 2025: First Call for Workshop & Tutorial Proposals

18th International Conference on Natural Language Generation
Venue and Date TBA

---

The 18th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG 2025) (https://2025.inlgmeeting.org/) will be held in TBA. Building on the success of previous years, we hope to include a number of independently organised research workshops and tutorials. These workshops and tutorials will take place immediately after or prior to the main conference. The INLG organisers and SIGGEN cordially invite workshop proposals for one-day or half-day workshops at INLG 2025.

Proposals can focus on any topic relevant to the Natural Language Generation community (NLG). We especially invite new and novel proposals in relatively new areas which have recently begun to attract interest in the research community, or topics where greater interaction between the NLG community and another established research community can be beneficial to both fields. Proposals that form part of an existing series, are also welcome.

Workshops and tutorials should provide an informal setting, where participants will have the opportunity to discuss technical topics in an atmosphere that fosters the active exchange of ideas. Proposals should also describe the format of the proposed workshop or tutorial. We encourage formats that will foster discussion and exchange of ideas (talks, posters, panels, invited speakers). Workshops and tutorials at INLG 2024 should be planned as half-day or full one-day events.

Proposals can be submitted via TBA. Should you have any questions, feel free to contact INLG 2025 Workshop Chair, Jing Li, email: jing-amelia.li@polyu.edu.hk
