# YNLG 2025: The 1st Workshop for Young Researchers in Natural Language Generation

Website: [https://ynlg-workshop.github.io/](https://ynlg-workshop.github.io/)


We invite early-career researchers to submit position papers to the first Workshop for Young Researchers in Natural Language Generation (YNLG 2025), to be held as part of INLG 2025 in Hanoi, Vietnam.

YNLG aims to foster a welcoming community of early-career researchers in NLG by providing a platform for PhD students and Master's students to present work-in-progress research, receive feedback from senior researchers and peers, and engage in discussions about current trends and future directions in Natural Language Generation.

The workshop is organized under the auspices of the Special Interest Group on Natural Language Generation (SIGGEN) of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). YNLG 2025 will take place during INLG 2025 (October 29 - November 2, 2025) at the Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics, Hanoi, Vietnam.


## Workshop Format

YNLG 2025 will be a full-day, in-person workshop featuring:

* **Poster Sessions**: Two sessions where participants present their submissions and engage with fellow researchers
* **Keynote Talks**: To be announced
* **Interactive Roundtables**: Small-group discussions on both research topics and practical aspects of academic life
* **Networking Social Event**: An informal evening event with sightseeing and dinner

## Important Dates

All deadlines are at 11:59 PM, UTC-8.

* **Submissions due**: August 26, 2025
* **Notification of acceptance**: September 24, 2025
* **Camera-ready papers due**: October 3, 2025 (Optional)
* **Workshop**: October 29 (during INLG 2025)

**Note**: Please observe the workshop [website](https://ynlg-workshop.github.io/) for updates.

## Submission Format

**Position Papers**: We invite 2-page position papers (+ unlimited references) that should include:

1. **Research Overview**: A description of your past, present, and future research plans in NLG
2. **Short Biography**: A brief academic biography highlighting your background and research interests
3. **Questions for Senior Researchers**: Specific questions you would like to ask senior researchers. These can be related to research or the general PhD experience and future careers. We will anonymize and aggregate these questions and release the answers for all of them with the proceedings of the workshop.
4. **Topics for Roundtable Discussions with Peers**: Suggestions for topics you would like to see discussed during the workshop's interactive roundtable sessions

The position paper format is designed to facilitate meaningful discussions during the workshop's poster sessions and roundtable discussions, rather than presenting fully completed research. There is no anonymity requirement and participants are encouraged to share their research backgrounds.

The participants can choose whether they prefer their submission to be published with the workshop proceedings.

## Topics of Interest

We invite position papers on any topic related to Natural Language Generation, including but not limited to:

* Large Language Models (LLMs) for NLG
* Evaluation and error analysis of NLG systems
* Explainability and trustworthiness of NLG systems
* Bias and fairness in NLG systems
* Data-to-text, concept-to-text, text-to-text, and vision-to-text approaches
* Grounded language generation
* NLG in dialogue systems and chatbots
* Storytelling and narrative generation
* Summarization and paraphrasing
* Multimodal and multimedia generation
* NLG for low-resourced languages
* Ethical considerations in NLG
* NLG applications and real-world deployment
* Computational efficiency of NLG models
* Content and text planning
* Surface realization and lexicalization

## Submission Instructions

Papers should be submitted through the workshop's submission system ([https://softconf.com/p/ynlg2025](https://softconf.com/p/ynlg2025)). All submissions will be checked by the organizers for topic fit. If applicable, the submission will receive at least two reviews from our program committee to suggest feedback and further research directions. 

Papers should follow the ACL formatting guidelines and be submitted as PDF files.
