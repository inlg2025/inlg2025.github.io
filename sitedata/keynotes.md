**Short Bio:** Dr. Michael White is Professor and Vice Chair in the Department of Linguistics at The Ohio State University. Prior to joining OSU, Dr. White was a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, and before that he was a partner in the pioneering NLG company CoGenTex. His research has focused on NLG in dialogue with an emphasis on surface realization, extending also to paraphrasing for ambiguity avoidance and data augmentation in the context of OSU’s virtual patient dialogue system. His current research is centered on bootstrapping techniques for training reliable dialogue systems with synthetic conversations and automatic evaluation. He co-organized the NSF Workshop on Shared Tasks in NLG which provided a crucial impetus for the initial shared tasks in NLG, and he was a co-organizer of the first surface realization shared task. From 2018 to 2021, Dr. White collaborated with conversational AI researchers at the company formerly known as Facebook, where he was twice a Visiting Research Scientist. At present, he is just managing to keep his head above water as one of the ACL Rolling Review Editors in Chief.
