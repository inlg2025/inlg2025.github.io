# GenChal @INLG 2025: Call for new Shared Task proposals

GenChal @ 18th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, Hanoi, Vietnam, October 29 - November 2, 2025

**Submission deadline: July 31st 2025**

We invite submissions of papers describing ideas for future shared tasks in the general area of language generation. Proposed tasks can be in the area of core NLG, or in other research areas in which language is generated. Examples include, but are not limited to: data-to-text NLG, text-to-text generation (including MT and summarisation), combining core NLG and MT, combining core NLG and text summarisation, NLG quality estimation, NLG evaluation metrics, and/or generating language from heterogeneous data, including image and video.

Submissions should describe possible future tasks in detail, including:
- information regarding organisers;
- task description;
- motivating theoretical interest and/or application context;
- size and state of completion of data to be used;
- detailed evaluation plan (evaluation method(s), cost, funding, etc.);
- possible need for ethical approval (e.g. for the human evaluation);
- general timeline.

Accepted shared tasks will be offered a slot to present (i) the task at [INLG 2025](https://2025.inlgmeeting.org/), and (ii) the results in the 2026 or 2027 edition of INLG, during the Generation Challenges (GenChal) special session of the main conference. The GenChal session traditionally comprises overviews of task results by the organisers of currently running shared tasks, a poster session for task participants to present their submissions, as well as presentations of proposals for new shared tasks. You can see some of the previous tasks in the past GenChal proceedings on the ACL Anthology (see e.g. [2022](https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2022.inlg-genchal/), [2023](https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2023.inlg-genchal/) or [2024](https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2024.inlg-genchal/)).

## Important dates
- **Submission deadline:** July 31st 2025.
- **Notification:** August 25th 2025.
- **Camera-ready submission:** September 15th 2025.
- **INLG:** October 29 - November 2, 2025.

All deadlines are 11.59 pm UTC -12h ("anywhere on Earth").

## Submissions and format
Submissions in the Shared Task Proposals track should be no more than 4 (four) pages long excluding citations, and should follow the [ACL Author Guidelines](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines), and use LaTeX style files and Microsoft Word templates found under [this link](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html).

Proposals should be uploaded on [SoftConf](https://softconf.com/p/inlg2025/), using the Submission type _New shared task proposal_.

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by the program committee. As reviewing will not be blind, there is no need to anonymise papers. 

This is not intended to be a selective process, since the aim is to discuss new potential shared tasks with INLG delegates. However, the organisers reserve the right to reject proposals which do not fall within the scope of the GenChal initiative, or which do not follow the guidelines. Accepted submissions will be published in separate GenChal 2023 proceedings on the ACL Anthology, as was done in [2022](https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2022.inlg-genchal/), [2023](https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2023.inlg-genchal/) and [2024](https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2024.inlg-genchal/).

Looking forward to seeing you at INLG!

### Call for Generation Challenges 2025
**Submission deadline: TBA**

We invite submissions of papers describing ideas for future shared tasks in the general area of language generation (Generation Challenges 2025). Proposed tasks can be in the area of core NLG, or in other research areas in which language is generated. Examples include, but are not limited to: data-to-text NLG, text-to-text generation (including MT and summarisation), combining core NLG and MT, combining core NLG and text summarisation, NLG quality estimation, NLG evaluation metrics, and/or generating language from heterogeneous data, including image and video.

The Generation Challenges (GenChal) are an umbrella event designed to bring together a variety of shared-task efforts that involve the generation of natural language. This year, Generation Challenges will be held as a workshop at the 18th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG 2025), scheduled on TBA. The workshop will follow the format of previous GenChal results sessions, with presentations of results by the organisers of the generation challenges that are currently running, a poster session for task participants to present their submissions, as well as presentations of proposals for new shared tasks in the Task Proposals Track, and discussion sessions. You can see some of the previous GenChal tasks in the past GenChal proceedings on the ACL Anthology (see e.g. 2022 or 2023) or on the dedicated repository.

Submissions should describe possible future tasks in detail, including information regarding organisers, task description, motivating theoretical interest and/or application context, size and state of completion of data to be used, schedule and evaluation plans. Accepted shared tasks will be run in the 2025 iteration of INLG.

### Important dates
- Submission deadline: TBA
